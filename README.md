Libraries: 
numpy: Library to work with matrices of data. Invertsing or transposing matrices is aimple with this library. Much friendlier to datframes than hand-coded customized methods. 

Pandas: Library to manipulate dataframe objects. This is crucial, as dataframe objects are easier to work with and aritmetic operations can be performed on it. 

Matplotlib: A library for simple graphing. This is used to asses for correlation or making meaning of sample data by analyzing it's frequency distributon.

Sklearn: Library to assist with machin learning models. We use the Linear Regression model in this library to build our regression function. Also has libraries on splitting data between trainign and testing models. 

Motivation: I like Regression techniques because you can use it to make accurate estimations of the future. I also am very fond of looking at sample data to make inferences about the larger population.

Results: 
1. Yes, a model can be produced. 
2. There is no correlation between the fields
3. A rating of 7 was the highest (mode).
